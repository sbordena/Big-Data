Light Beer purchases in the US

All data can be found at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bw_UjrqiL3Maakp1TVJ4VGZnZzQ&usp=sharing

The data are 73,115 observations light beer purchases in the US. These observations are taken
from the Nielsen Home-Scan database.
lightbeer.csv contains:
 household: an identifier of the purchasing household
 upc description: details on the purchased item (e.g., a 6-pack)
 quantity: the number of items purchased
 beer brand: Bud Light, Busch Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, or Natural Light.
 beer spend: total dollar value of purchase.
 beer floz: total volume of beer, in fluid ounces.
 price floz: price per fl.oz. (i.e., beer spend/beer floz)
 container descr: the type of container.
 promotion Whether the item was promoted (coupon or otherwise).
 market: Scantrack market (or state if rural)
 demographic data, including buyer type (married couple, male, or female), income, occupation,
education, age, and whether the household has a dishwasher or a microwave.
We will consider beer spend, price floz, and beer brand (and transformations thereof)
as the responses of interest.

1 Linear models and false discovery control
Our starter script defines the basic regression mle.
1.1
Write the mathematical formula for the regression model behind mle and describe it in words.
You donâ€™t need to list every demographic variable, but be sure to describe important interactions
and the probability model that is implied by the deviance weâ€™ve minimized. What is our estimate
for the error variance?
1.2
Compare (i.e., with a plot) the fitted residuals and log volume. Based upon this plot alone, (a)
describe the fit and (b) suggest one degree of freedom that could be added to your model to
improve the fit (and see how it works).
1.3
Given the original mle fit, all other things equal, what is the change in price
 for Rural North Dakota relative to Chicago?
 for Bush Light relative to Natural Light?
 for Coors Light due to promotion, at average log volume?
 for a Coors Light 6 pack (12oz cans) due to promotion?
1.4
Plot the p-value distribution. What does it tell you about the underlying signal in this regression?
What is the p-value cutoff for an FDR of 1%? What is the FDR at a p-value cutoff of 0.05?
1.5
Run a bootstrap for the sampling distribution of the coefficient on log(volume) â€“ logvol â€“ using
the code and random seed in the starter script. Compare the 80% confidence interval built from
your bootstrap to the theoretical 80% confidence interval implied by summary(mle). Give
potential explanations for any discrepancy in the regions covered by these intervals.

2 Treatment Effects Estimation
For this question, weâ€™ll attempt to measure the treatment effect of pricing on sales (measured
as exp(logspend)). In the starter script, Iâ€™ve built for you one large model matrix of demographic
information and another containing beer information (brand, promotion status).
2.1
Fit a univariate regression for logspend on logprice, as well as a lasso with AICc selection
for logspend onto logprice and demographic and beer information. Describe in words
and compare each procedureâ€™s estimate for the sensitivity of sales to price.
2.2
Describe why you should be suspect of the estimates from each procedure in 2.1. How would
you instead implement a randomized controlled trial to estimate price sensitivity, and why
would your suspicions no longer apply in that setting?
2.3
Build a model to predict logprice from the controls. Describe the in-sample fit for this
regression; what are the implications for your ability to measure the treatment effect of price?
2.4
Use the fitted values from 2.3 in a new lasso that estimates the treatment effect of logprice
on logspend. How does your estimate compare from the naive lasso in 2.1, if at all? Why?
2.5
Repeat both the naive lasso and the treatment lasso for only transactions in Los Angeles by
people making more than $200,000. You should use the same price regression from 2.3; why?
Compare the estimated price effects to each other and to the full sample results.

3 Lasso Linear Regression and Model Selection
The starter script defines a large design of interactions between price and our other variables.
This is combined with the beer and demographic information in the sparse matrix x.
3.1
Run a cross-validated lasso for logspend onto x. Describe the criteria used to choose models
under select="1se" and select="min" rules. What are estimated out-of-sample R2 for
models fit under each rule?
3.2
Compare AICc, AIC, and BIC selection for this lasso to each other and to the CV choices. (You
can exponentiate each IC divided by n to plot them on the same scale as the CV results).
3.3
What is the effect of price on sales of Bud Light for people earning > $200k in Los Angeles?
Compare this to the treatment effect estimates in question 2. Why is it different and in what
settings would we prefer the current model?
3.4
What is the average price sensitivity in our model? What is the price sensitivity for the median
consumer (see starter script for xbar median).
3.5
Bootstrap to estimate the sampling distribution for the AICc selected model degrees of freedom
(note that you donâ€™t need to run CV in the bootstrap). You can alter the bootstrap code that is
written for you in the starter script. Compare the results to your full sample AICc regression
degrees of freedom, and attempt to describe the sources of any discrepancy.

4 Logistic Regression and Classification
4.1
Define the binary outcome variable ybud that is one for Bud Light and zero otherwise. Fit the
lasso path for regression of ybud onto the demographic information in xdemog (no need for
cross validation). Plot and describe (quickly) the fitted values.
4.2
What is the precise function that was minimized when fitting the AICc selected model here?
What is the in-sample R2 for this fit?
4.3
What is the sensitivity and specificity of a classification rule that considers every consumer with
probability greater than 0.1 of buying Bud Light a potential Bud customer? Plot the ROC curve
and add this point to the picture.
4.4
Looking only at the main effect coefficient (in starter script), how do the odds of a consumer
choosing Bud Light change in Rural California relative to the intercept market? What markets
are included in this intercept? How does the story change when you consider interaction
between income and being in Rural California?
4.5
Use the starter script commands to run a multinomial logistic regression for brand choice onto
the demographic info. Quickly describe the computing environment set up by the makeCluster
command here (including the number of cores you are using). Consider the multinomial regression
coefficients related to your answers in 4.4: what can you add to your story?
