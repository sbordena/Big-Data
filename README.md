1/ EFFICIENT MARKETS
The data for this question is in market.csv. 

We consider daily stock returns for Google and Starbucks (RET.GOOG and RET.SBUX), the risk-free rate of return (RF), the market return over risk-free rate (MKTminusRF), as well as the two extra variables in a Fama-French three factor model:

SMB, “small minus big”, which measures the excess return of small over large cap stocks.

HML, “high minus low”, which measures the excess return of value stocks over growth stocks.

We also include a momentum factor, MOM, which some believe is necessary to explain returns. These factors are available on Ken French’s website. For further detail, see Fama & French, “The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns” from the Journal of Finance 47, 1992, pages 427–465.

Which is the best model for each of Google and Starbucks stocks? Evaluate relative evidence for CAPM, the three-factor model, and a momentum factor.

2/ WINE SALES IN AUSTRALIA

The data for this question, contained in wine.csv, includes monthly sales of some Australian fortified wine, in thousands of liters, from Jan 1996 to Dec 2010. Your task here is to find an appropriate time-series regression model for this data. Your analysis should include development of a small number of candidate models (up to 3), selection of a best model along with justification of this choice, and the forecast for January 2011 sales.

3/ THE CHURN MODEL FOR A TELEPHONE COMPANY

Churning, that is, leaving the company in favor of a competitor, is a common concern of CRM managers. A CRM manager in a telephone company plans to develop a model for churn prediction. She hopes that the model will allow the company to detect potential churners, helping to plan the retention campaigns.

The database is available as churn.csv with 19 fields. It contains information about 3,333 customers, including: the length of the account, dummies for having a voice mail plan and an international call plan, the number of voice mail messages, the intensity of use of the service for different parts of the day, the intensity of international calling, the number of calls to the customer service and a dummy for churning. 

Your task is to build a churner detector, i.e., to build a predictor for detecting which customers are churners and which are not.
